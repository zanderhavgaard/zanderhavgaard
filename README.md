Hi there, I'm zander!
```

- I'm currently hacking @ [green.ai](https://green.ai) in Copenhagen 🌇

- I do a bit of everything, but my interests mainly lie within Cloud Native, DevOps and Backend development 🚀

- I'm a big fan of FOSS, Linux, tiling WMs and NeoVim ❤️

- I'm active in the meetup scene, so if you see me, please come and say hi! 👋

##### Getting in touch

I don't use social media, so the best way to reach me is to send an email to `contact (at) pzh (dot) dk` 📫

##### Fun facts:

- I name all of my computers after spaceships, real and fictional 🛸
- I run Arch linux (btw) 🐧
- On my own time I like obsessing over my dotfiles and NeoVim configuration, trying to brew the perfect cup of filter coffee, building and collecting (mechanical) keyboards, DnD, cyberpunk (the genre), cyberpunk (the pen and paper RPG), and much more 🎲
